## 🌍 Real-World Impact

Mental health has become a critical concern in today's fast-paced and digitally-driven world. Long wait times for therapists, stigma around seeking help, and lack of immediate emotional support are pressing problems — especially for young adults and students.

This chatbot bridges that gap by:
- Providing **24/7** AI-driven mental health support.
- Offering **non-judgmental listening** and emotional wellness resources.
- Encouraging **early intervention** through conversation-based therapy.
- Supporting underserved regions where mental health professionals are unavailable.
